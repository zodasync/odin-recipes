    <p><h2>Instant Pot Chili Recipe</h2>
    This was ripped straight from my favorite recipie (found here <a href="https://ohsweetbasil.com/instant-pot-award-winning-chili-recipe/#recipe">Best Chili Ever</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
      This hearty and flavorful Instant Pot chili is perfect for a cozy meal that's ready in no time. 
      Packed with ground meat, beans, tomatoes, and aromatic spices, it's a one-pot wonder that's both easy to prepare and utterly satisfying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Start by sautéing onions, garlic, and your choice of ground beef, turkey, or plant-based protein in the Instant Pot using the sauté function. 
      Add chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, and a pinch of cayenne for a smoky kick. Stir in canned diced tomatoes, tomato paste, kidney beans, 
      black beans, and a cup of beef or vegetable broth to create a rich and hearty base.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seal the Instant Pot lid and set it to pressure cook on high for about 15-20 minutes. 
      Once the cooking time is up, allow for a natural release or quick release if you're short on time. Stir the chili, taste, and adjust the seasoning as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serve your chili piping hot with classic toppings like shredded cheese, sour cream, chopped green onions, or fresh cilantro. 
      Pair it with cornbread or tortilla chips for a deliciously comforting meal.
